I"Ö<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>Today Iâ€™m starting to develop a new note application. I hope it helps you this article series. Because Iâ€™m going to cover all development processes on simple way.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s start by designing  use case diagrams.</p>

<p>Mobile devices are most connected to Internet as you know. Thatâ€™s why we chose mobile users as actor in the  use case diagrams and  there are 6 use cases.</p>

<p>Below shown use case diagram:

<p><br /></p>

<p>It is wrote user stories to better explain the  user diagram.</p>
