I"T<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>Today I’m starting to develop a new note application. I hope it helps you this article series. Because I’m going to cover all development processes on simple way.</p>

<p>Let’s start by designing  use case diagrams.</p>

<p>Mobile devices are most connected to Internet as you know. That’s why we chose mobile users as actor in the  use case diagrams and  there are 6 use cases.</p>

<p>Below shown use case diagram:
<img src="/assets/img/noteapp_use_cases.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It is wrote user stories to better explain the  user diagram.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>User Story 1:</strong> Show All Notes <br />
<strong>Priority:</strong> High <br />
<strong>Estimate:</strong> 13 <br />
<strong>Description:</strong> <br /></p>
<pre>
 1. Click the note application on mobile phone
 2. Get notes by limit 10 from database
 3. List notes that got in.
</pre>
<p><strong>Acceptance Criterias:</strong> <br /></p>
<pre>
 1. Listed notes must be clickable.
 2. User can load 10 notes when click "load more" button everytimes.
</pre>

<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Everything is OK for the user story  ? :) Unfortunately NO. Some statements seem vague. For example; “Get notes by limit 10 from database”. How?
You should explain it such that you can’t ask the question of HOW.
<br /></p>

<p>Let’s write this row again.</p>

<pre>
 - Connect the local database by "Room" persistence library provided by Android
 - Get "id", "title", "content", "create date", "update date" values of "NOTES" table for 10 records using Room
</pre>
