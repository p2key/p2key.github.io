I"g<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>Today I’m starting to develop a new note application. I hope it helps you this article series. Because I’m going to cover all development processes on simple way.</p>

<p>Let’s start by designing  use case diagrams.</p>

<p>Mobile devices are most connected to Internet as you know. That’s why we chose mobile users as actor in the  use case diagrams and  there are 6 use cases.</p>

<p>Below shown use case diagram:

<p><br /></p>

<p>It is wrote user stories to better explain the  user diagram.</p>
